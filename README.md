Reflection
Creating this portfolio was both challenging and rewarding. The main challenge was ensuring all assets loaded correctly on GitHub Pages, but it strengthened my problem-solving skills. I especially enjoyed designing a responsive and visually appealing interface that reflects my personal style. This project reinforced my understanding of modern web development and the satisfaction of seeing my work live online.
